# drupal-lamp #

A vagrant build to run a Drupal LAMP stack utilizing best practices.

Our vision is to aid the Drupal Community by removing the complexity of managing a development environment and to offer a bridge to maintain parity and best practices when going live.  [Interact with the roadmap](https://github.com/newmediadenver/drupal-lamp/issues/milestones) to help direct this project.

There are three requirements that you need to manage before you can begin.
* Mac OSX or Linux OS (Have not tested on Windows)
* You need to install virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* You need to install vagrant 1.4.0 or greater http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

To install drupal-lamp run:
````
bash <(curl https://raw.github.com/newmediadenver/drupal-lamp/master/setup)
````

## Why are you doing this? ##
There's a big, complex problem that is instantly born when someone has the thought "I need to spin up a new drupal site."  Personally, I'm tired of having to spend any time thinking about how to do that. This project is part of a larger DevOps conversation that is relevant and gaining momentum.
